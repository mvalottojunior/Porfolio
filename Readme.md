## 🚀 Capstone Project – SpaceX Falcon 9 Landing Prediction

### Abstract
This project explores SpaceX launch data to **predict Falcon 9 first stage landing success**. Using multiple classification models, I analyzed factors such as payload mass, launch site, orbit, and booster version to determine the likelihood of a successful landing.  

### Key Steps
- Collected and cleaned SpaceX data (API + web scraping).  
- Built ML models: **Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Decision Tree**.  
- Achieved accuracy of ~**87%** with Decision Tree and SVM.  
- Developed interactive dashboards with **Plotly/Dash** and **Folium maps**.  

### Key Findings
- Low-payload launches into **Low Earth Orbit (LEO)** have the highest probability of success.  
- Booster version and flight number strongly correlate with landing outcomes.  
- Data-driven predictions align with SpaceX’s reusable rocket strategy.
